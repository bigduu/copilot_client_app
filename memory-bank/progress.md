   - Modularized components and hooks

3. Backend Features
   - Modular Copilot client integration
   - Authentication/session management
   - Message channel and streaming logic
   - Improved error handling and IPC communication

### In Progress
1. UI/UX Development
   - Finalizing search and filtering features
   - Polishing streaming message UI and performance
   - Refining system prompt and settings modals
   - Enhancing chat navigation and favorites

2. Backend Development
