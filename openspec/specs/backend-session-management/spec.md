# backend-session-management Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change refactor-rwlock-concurrency. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Concurrent Read Access to Contexts
The session manager SHALL allow multiple concurrent read operations on the same chat context without blocking each other.

#### Scenario: Multiple clients reading same context
- **GIVEN** a chat context exists in the cache
- **WHEN** multiple clients issue GET requests for the same context ID simultaneously
- **THEN** all requests SHALL be processed concurrently without waiting for each other
- **AND** each request SHALL receive consistent data

#### Scenario: Read during write
- **GIVEN** a chat context is being modified
- **WHEN** a read request arrives for the same context
- **THEN** the read request SHALL wait until the write completes
- **AND** the read SHALL see the updated state

### Requirement: Exclusive Write Access to Contexts
The session manager SHALL ensure exclusive write access when modifying chat contexts.

#### Scenario: Sequential write operations
- **GIVEN** a chat context exists
- **WHEN** multiple write requests target the same context
- **THEN** writes SHALL be processed sequentially
- **AND** each write SHALL see the changes from previous writes

#### Scenario: Write blocks reads
- **GIVEN** a write operation is in progress on a context
- **WHEN** read requests arrive for the same context
- **THEN** reads SHALL wait until the write completes
- **AND** reads SHALL see the updated data

### Requirement: Zero-Copy Context Read Operations
The session manager SHALL provide read access to contexts without cloning the underlying data.

#### Scenario: DTO generation from reference
- **GIVEN** a cached chat context
- **WHEN** generating a DTO for API response
- **THEN** the context data SHALL be read by reference
- **AND** no clone of message_pool SHALL occur
- **AND** only necessary fields SHALL be extracted

#### Scenario: Message list extraction
- **GIVEN** a context with N messages in message_pool
- **WHEN** extracting messages for a specific branch
- **THEN** only the message IDs and content SHALL be copied
- **AND** the full context SHALL NOT be cloned

### Requirement: Minimal Lock Scope
All lock acquisitions SHALL be scoped to the minimum necessary duration.

#### Scenario: Lock released before serialization
- **GIVEN** a GET request for a context
- **WHEN** processing the request
- **THEN** the lock SHALL be held only during data extraction
- **AND** the lock SHALL be released before JSON serialization
- **AND** the lock SHALL be released before network transmission

#### Scenario: Lock released before file I/O
- **GIVEN** a context modification that requires persistence
- **WHEN** saving to storage
- **THEN** the context lock MAY be held during storage.save_context()
- **BUT** cache locks SHALL be released before storage I/O

### Requirement: Lock Ordering Consistency
The system SHALL maintain consistent lock acquisition ordering to prevent deadlocks.

#### Scenario: Cache then context lock order
- **GIVEN** code needs both cache and context locks
- **WHEN** acquiring locks
- **THEN** the cache lock SHALL be acquired first
- **AND** the context lock SHALL be acquired second
- **AND** this order SHALL be enforced throughout the codebase
