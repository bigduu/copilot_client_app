## Brief overview
This rule establishes a mandatory "Plan-then-Act" workflow. Before any significant action or modification is made to the project, a detailed plan must be documented and receive explicit user approval. This process ensures clarity, alignment, and prevents unintended changes.

## Development Workflow
- **1. Propose a Plan**: Before taking any action (e.g., writing code, modifying files), formulate a plan that outlines the proposed changes, the reasoning behind them, and the expected outcome.
- **2. Seek User Approval**: Present the plan to the user for review. Do not proceed until the user gives explicit approval.
- **3. Execute the Plan**: Once approval is granted, execute the steps exactly as outlined in the plan.
- **4. Report Completion**: After execution, report the completion of the task and update any relevant documentation, such as the memory bank.
