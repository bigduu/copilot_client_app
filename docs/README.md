* **Smarter Input Enhancements**: Drag or paste multiple file types, highlight `/workflow` commands, and insert workspace files via `@` mentions.

## 🛠️ How to Get Started

Ready to dive in? Here's how you can get the application up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Awesome Repository:** 📂
    First things first, grab a copy of the code!

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url> # Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL!
    cd copilot_chat
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** 📦
    Make sure you have Node.js (with npm or Yarn) and Rust installed on your system. These are the building blocks of our app!

    ```bash
    yarn install # or npm install
    ```

3. **Configure API Access:** 🔑
    * This application needs a GitHub Copilot API token to communicate with the service.
    * You'll likely need to create a `.token` file in the `src-tauri` directory and paste your token there.
    * Alternatively, it might be configurable via an environment variable.
    * _(Developer Note: Please update this section with the precise method for token configuration!)_

4. **Run in Development Mode:** 🚀
    See the magic happen! This command launches the app with live reloading.

    ```bash
    yarn tauri dev # or npm run tauri dev
    ```

5. **Build for Production:** 📦🏭
    Ready to create a distributable version? This command bundles everything up.

    ```bash
    yarn tauri build # or npm run tauri build
    ```

6. **Keep the Codebase Styled:** 🧹
   Run Prettier before sending changes to ensure a consistent style.

   ```bash
   npm run format
   # or validate without writing changes
   npm run format:check
   ```

## 🚨 Important: Data Migration Notice

**Version 2.0+** introduces a major architectural change: chat context is now managed by the backend instead of browser LocalStorage.

### First Launch After Upgrade
1. A **migration banner** will appear if you have existing chat data
2. Click **"Migrate now"** to transfer your chats, messages, and system prompts to the backend
3. The migration includes automatic validation and creates a backup for safety
4. If something goes wrong, use **"Rollback from backup"** to restore your data

See [Context Manager Migration Guide](./docs/architecture/context-manager-migration.md) for details.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### LLM-Driven Tools
Tools are low-level operations the LLM can invoke autonomously:
- **Read-only**: `read_file`, `search` - Safe information gathering
- **Write with approval**: `create_file`, `update_file`, `append_file` - Require user approval
- **System prompt injection**: Tools are automatically injected into LLM context
- **Agent loop**: Backend orchestrates multi-step tool execution

### User-Invoked Workflows
Workflows are complex operations users explicitly trigger:
- **Form-based UI**: User fills parameter form before execution
- **Safety gates**: Approval prompts with security warnings
- **Categories**: Organized by functionality (general, file_operations, system)
- **Examples**: `ExecuteCommandWorkflow`, `DeleteFileWorkflow`

### Key Differences
| Aspect | Tools | Workflows |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Who Invokes** | LLM (autonomous) | User (explicit) |
| **UI** | JSON parameters | Form-based |
| **Risk Level** | Low-Medium | High |
| **Examples** | Read file, Search | Execute command, Delete file |

See the [Agent Loop Architecture](./docs/architecture/AGENT_LOOP_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed information.
