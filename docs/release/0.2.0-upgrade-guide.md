# Copilot Chat 0.2.0 Upgrade Notes

The 0.2.0 release ships a large UI/UX refactor with backend-synchronised chat
state. Review the steps below before deploying to production.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- ✅ Ensure the backend Context Manager service is running with the latest schema.
- ✅ Back up the `user_preferences` table (auto title setting + last chat id).
- ✅ Communicate the downtime window to users (expected < 5 minutes).

## Required User Actions

- On first launch after the update, users should **sign out and sign back in** to
  refresh their workspace token and synchronise chat contexts.
- If the app still shows an empty chat list, instruct users to press **Reload
  Chats** in the sidebar (or rerun `Sync from Backend` in the settings modal).

## Clearing Local Data (if needed)

Should a user encounter inconsistent state (missing chats, stale prompts), ask
them to:

1. Close the desktop app.
2. Delete the `CopilotChat` directory under their platform-specific app data:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/CopilotChat`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\CopilotChat`
   - Linux: `~/.config/CopilotChat`
3. Reopen the app and log in again. The backend will restore their latest chats
   and preferences.

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

- Watch the backend logs for `chat_session` sync failures.
- Verify the auto title generation queue is draining without errors.
- Confirm the UI build identifies itself as version `0.2.0` in the settings modal.
